# Streetheart

A revival of my original Ruby on Rails [Streetheart] appliation.

## Features

Should be able to see local street art on a map
Should be able to add new street art to map
Should be able to see filtered art of just an artist, posted by a user, etc.
Should have artist profiles
Should allow people to post walls available for street art

### Notes

This would be a good app to also make use of the mapping-framework app idea.
