# App Ideas

This very app! A collection of applications that I should consider spending my "free" time building rather than just grinding out more hours doing work work.


## Features

- Should have a list of apps
- Should have a common format for documenting an app's details
- Should have a CLI
- Should be able to spin up a new repo for an app when given the app's name
  - Should be able to populate github issues from this "Features" list
  - Should be able to populate README
  - Should update the app page with link to newly created github repo
    - Should have some convention to demarcate apps that have been kicked off and have a repo -- dotfile them?
  - Should be able to create a new app idea
    - Multi step like eslint cli initilizer
