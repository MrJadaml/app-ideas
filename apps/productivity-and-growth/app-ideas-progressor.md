# App Ideas Progressor

This app should kick out notifications to encourage continual development of apps, so that they don't go forgotten and stale.

## Features

- Should send out notifications
  - Determine what time of notifications would be best
- Should probably default to apps that have been kicked off
- Should be able to add apps that were not initially part of this repo's list
  - Should be able to add outside repos (open-source)
- Should link to specific issue/ticket work - more actionable
  - Should point to low story point tickets at first -- more actionable
    - Should probably have some algo for determining value -- high priority --> low story points
