### Notes

This will work as a sort of extension to the BoardGameGeek.com community. Ideally would be able to tap into that site's community to drive traffic

Maybe reach out to game makers to request image assets. Will both reduce workload and also allow for higher quality assets.

Start with getting the content for the [BGG top 100]. Once the top 100 are documented look into extending to include game boards, tiles, pieces, etc
