An [Strava] like app, but for drone racing courses. This app would be a place where drone racers could
 conveniently find great places to fly their racng drones and also be able to passivly compete with other drone racers.


## Features

- Should have a classic map/list interface showing nearby courses.

- Should have "follow" features at racer, rig types, course, and region level.
- Should have course detail view documenting things like best time/racer, length, elevation changes, etc.
