# Mapping Framework

A framework to create map-based applications. This would be an abstraction layer above tools like leaflet, mapbox, google-maps,
 in that it would be built on top of those APIs. The framework would lay the core foundation for creating apps that are map-centric,
 providing an api consumable to the more beginer level developer, or quick-start prototyping and greenfielding of an app.

This may be something like a squarespace or wordpress type CMS, or could be more like a web framework providing common mapping CRUD features??

## Features

- Should preconfigure mapping API tools/libs
- Should bootstrap a basic map-centric web app
  - Should have classic map/list interface
  - Should have generic map CRUD for custom entities
    - Things like pins/polygons/lines/path-ing
    - Entities should have default generated "detail" views
- Should bootstrap basic user system
  - accounts, auth, follows, ownership, etc
