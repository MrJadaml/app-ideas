# Cheat Sheet

Create a cheat sheet app called _Cheadle_. You should be able to access it from the command line,
where it will either cat out a response (if it's short) or less it out like  a man page if it is long.


## Features

It's own help page should begin with ascii art of Don Cheadle.
It should have a way to add new cheat sheet snipits.
