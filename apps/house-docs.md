# House Docs

An app that documents the ins and outs of your house. A house is a complex "living" system, why shouldn't it come with a manual?

## Features
- CRUD for appliances/fixtures
 - Should have populated lists for major appliances like refrigerators or water heaters
- Should be able to add a log for the service of a item
- Should have manuals populate for items in dropdown lists
- Should have a place to store receipts
- Should have a place to keep photos of things like pipes/wires in walls before drywall goes on so you don't have to worry as much years later when you want to cut in for that remodel
