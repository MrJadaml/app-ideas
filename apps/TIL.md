# TIL

Create a TIL (Today I Learned) app. New entries should be able to be added though new markdown files or via a CLI tool (for simple ones)

## Features

- Should be able to add tags to an entry
- README.md file should show a list of all tags
- There should be a suggestion tool for tags
- There should be an autocomplete tool for tags
- Should kick out an old TIL from time to time so that you don't forget how to do stuffs (recall / cadence)
